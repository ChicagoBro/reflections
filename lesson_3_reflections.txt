When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    For other contributors to add to your work in order to consider what stays and what doesn't among the group.
    This then gets pushed to "local" once it's agreed upon.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    "Pulling" commits from GitHub into your local repository makes changes permanent that could? 
	be reversed or set to another branch (I think). Some of these commits might be from
	other contributors to code and may not help with what you're currently doing or does not
	comply with what you want the final product to be. It also might make the final code file
	more messy or filled with code that does nothing or adds nothing to the product.
